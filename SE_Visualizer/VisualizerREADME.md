# Introduction 
- To interrogate the Github API, I created a website using Django to do all the front end stuff such as display users and such and to handle the server side also.
- As for everything else,  I used a few other libraries to complete the graphs and such like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Demonstration
- The use of the api is quite simple, we enter a username into the search bar and we get returned a list of users from the Github API
- The code then takes the first value from the list and sends it to a view to display the user and their details.

- There's a Home button and also a return button to get new inputs also.
- As for the second part(Graphical breakdowns) I used matplot and Seaborn to generate graphs based on 
existing large libraries.
